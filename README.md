## Hello! I am Carlo. :wave:
### :computer: Welcome to my GitHub repo. 
#### I am in love with technology, creating things, and learn how things work.
#### I founded a (wip) tech company, moving from a managerial role in a large company to a strictly operational role in my startup.
### :zap: Coding happens to be the best proxy to satisfy my thirst for knowledge, having fun along the way. 

:chart_with_upwards_trend: I worked for a Swiss multinational company active in commodity trading for over 10 years covering various roles but always close to the technological field (risk management, digital ops).

:rocket: In 2021 I left this job to start my own company, <a href="https://www.azionadigitale.com/" target = "_blank"> Aziona. </a>

:computer: I had my first <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qoN0HhDnRR8/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">386dx</a> at 12. It was love at first sight. And I never stopped that relationship.

:snake: I took a methodical approach to programming with Python in 2017. Since then, I've been working with it and studying it more or less intensively.

:comet: I like to experiment and try new things. I have studied and played with Solidity, C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Assembly. 

:floppy_disk: I'm available for:
- collaborations
- open source projects
- sharing learning and study methodologies
