## Hello! I am Carlo. :wave:
### :computer: Welcome to my GitHub repo. 
#### Althought I am not a developer by profession, 
#### I am in love with technology, creating things, and learn how things work.
### :zap: Coding happens to be the best proxy to satisfy all these needs of mine. 

:chart_with_upwards_trend: I worked for a Swiss multinational company active in commodity trading for over 10 years covering various roles but always close to the technological field.

:rocket: In 2021 I left this job to start my own company, <a href="https://www.azionadigitale.com/" target = "_blank"> Aziona </a>.

:snake: I started programming with Python by chance in 2017. Since then, I've been working with it and studying it more or less intensively.

Sometimes I've been using JavaScript and studied a bit of C++ and C#, the latter essentially to play with Unity. But mostly just experiments.

:space_invader: I'm not a gamer but I'm very passionate about  everything revolving around video games. 

:floppy_disk: I'm available for:
- collaborations
- open source projects
- sharing learning and study methodologies
